## Project Brief
"Create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."

### Proposal
A database of historical battles and generals. Users would be able to read, edit, delete and add to the database with generals and battles of their interest.

## Risk Assessment
---

|Risk No.|Risk|Description|Hazard|Likelihood|Impact|Solution|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1.0.1|Running out of time.|Project left unfinished due to poor time management.|Project may be incomplete and marks lost as a result.|2|5|Manage time and plan objectives through use of Kanban board, ensure work is completed early.|
|1.0.2|Data breach on workstation.|Work station is compromised.|Severe progress loss.|1|5|Change passwords on workstation, keep instances off when not in use.|
|1.1.1|Depleted GCP credit.|An instance is left running, or an account breach enables the resources on the account to be drained.|Databases unable to be access|1|5|Continue monitoring GCP usage. Copy databases offline as final backup.|
|1.1.2.1|Database security: SQL| A GCP server is breached.|Data potentially lost or destroyed|2|5|Ensure passwords are secure, backup code where possible.|
|1.2.1|Health problem: Injury|I suffer an injury due to an accident or physical attack.|Potentially become unable to complete the project|1|5|Avoid situations with risk of injury.|
|1.2.2|Health problem: Disease|I catch a serious infection|Potentially become unable to complete the project|2|5|Ensure good hygene and cleanliness|
